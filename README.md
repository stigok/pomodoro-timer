> A Pomodoro timer

## Install

    $: git clone https://github.com/stigok/pomodoro-timer
    $: cd pomodoro-timer
    $: npm i -g .

Not published to official npm repo because another project already exists as `pomodoro-timer` (which is probably [worth checking out as well](https://github.com/niftylettuce/pomodoro-timer)).

## Usage

    # Runs in background
    $: pomodoro [minutes]

    # Blocking version
    $: pomodoro-timer [minutes]

Default timer set to 25 minutes

## Notes

Tested on Arch Linux with `libnotify` and `notify-osd`. Maybe it works on macOS too?
